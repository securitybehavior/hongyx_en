                              <div class="mb-4">  Special issue on Insider Threats in Cyber Security </div>
                            <div class="mb-3"> The human and technological aspects of cyber security must be simultaneously addressed to enable a secure information environment. The behavior of insiders is a recognized and significant source of incidents. Insider threats can have both intentional and unintentional origins. Therefore, building security culture, cultivating information security awareness, and effectively motivating security behaviors are important ways to reduce related risks.
This special issue seeks original research and review articles relating to insider threats, contributing to theoretical development and supporting advancements in practice. Interdisciplinary contributions are welcome, recognizing that insider threats span different areas, including IT, system science, psychology, economics, and management.

                            <div class="mb-4"> Environmental Disasters and Individuals’ Emergency Preparedness: In the Perspective of Psychology and Behavior </div> 
                           <div class="mb-3">Environmental disasters are becoming more frequent. These disasters not only include the most common natural disasters, but also include man-made disasters, such as public health, accident
disasters, etc., which have caused greater damage to human society and cities. Because of the limitations of a single government-led model in emergency response, the emergency preparedness
of communities, families and individuals are more important. In particular, the emergency preparedness psychology and behavior of individuals directly determine whether or not they can
effectively protect themselves and their families in the first time of disaster. This Special Issue focuses on environmental disasters and individuals’ emergency preparedness in the perspective of
psychology and behavior.</div>
